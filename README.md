# Scooby-Doo

## Tidy Tuesday Scooby doo dataset

Scooby-Doo is a funny and nervous Great Dane. In its original series, in each episode, Scooby-Doo hunts ghosts with four human teens, 
including Shaggy Rogers (owner and best friend of Scooby-Doo), smart Velma, Fred, and beautiful Daphne. The show follows the iconic 
mystery solving detectives, known as Mystery Inc., as they set out in the Mystery Machine to solve crime and unmask criminals, bent on 
revenge or committing criminal acts for their own personal gain. Scooby-doo is rewarded with "Scooby-Doo Treats", dog food that makes 
him go wild with joy. 

The *Scooby* dataset was collected from the well-known American animation show Scooby-Doo, which contains information about every 
Scooby-Doo episode and movie's various variables. It took *plummye* around 1 year to watch every Scooby-Doo iteration and track every 
variable. The dataset contains 75 columns. Since Scooby-Doo is a popular show in the US, the IMDB rating is one of the scores to 
reflect whether the audiences like or dislike the show. Therefore, in this project, I will explore some factors that may be related to 
the IMDB rating for Scooby-Doo.
